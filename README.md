# Read This First
This project was done while learning Linear Regression using SKLearn
Very simple project using 5 sets of data about a student which correlates to his/her performance
The model is pre-trained and has an accuracy of 96%
The algorithm is simple enough to be understood by anyone.
I have left the training code which trains the model to the accuracy that the analyst needs.
I left the visualizing code commented, the user can uncomment it.

Requirement:
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Sklearn
4. Matplotlib(for visualizing data)

Note that all files must be in the same directory
